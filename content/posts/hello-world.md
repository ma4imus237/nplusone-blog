This is the first post on **n+1**. A space for ideas, one increment at a time.

## Why n+1?

Every interesting problem starts with a question: *what comes next?* The name is borrowed from mathematics, the inductive step, the next iteration, the perpetual move forward.

## What to expect

Short essays on technology, software engineering, and the occasional tangent into whatever catches my attention. No fixed schedule, no fixed format. Just writing.

Sometimes in English, sometimes in German. The language follows the thought.

## A minimal beginning

This blog is deliberately sparse. No images in the feed, no colorful accents, no distractions. Just text, typography, and whitespace. The design is inspired by academic journals and editorial blogs, places where the writing is the point.

Let's see where this goes.
